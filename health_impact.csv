Keytruda,"Probabilistic Durable Control",Increased long-term overall survival,"Reduced risk of death (e.g., HR=0.60 in NSCLC)","1.2-3.5 incremental QALYs (highly dependent on LTS assumption)","Often high ($>100,000/QALY); can be cost-effective (~$43,000/QALY) with LTS assumption",Avoidance of subsequent lines of therapy and end-of-life care,Extended survival and disease-free time in working-age population,"High price for heterogeneous benefit; cumulative budget impact"
Ozempic,Broad-Based Risk Reduction,"MACE reduction and prevention of T2D/CVD progression","Reduced risk of all-cause death (HR=0.81 in SELECT trial)","0.25-0.9 incremental QALYs over lifetime","Not cost-effective at current prices (~$467,000/QALY); requires >80% price cut","Prevention of future diabetes, cardiovascular, and kidney disease events","Reduced absenteeism/presenteeism from obesity, T2D, and CVD",System-level budget impact due to vast eligible population
Insulin,Foundational Chronic Management,"Glycemic control and prevention of acute/chronic complications","Reduced risk of death with high adherence (HR=0.80)","~0.1 incremental QALYs for modern vs. older analogs","Varies by type/delivery; modern analogs can be dominant (cheaper & more effective)","Avoidance of costly acute (DKA) and chronic (retinopathy, nephropathy) complications",Maintained work capacity by preventing disabling complications,Ensuring access and adherence to prevent high downstream costs
Sovaldi,Definitive Cure,Viral eradication (cure) of HCV,"Prevents liver-related death by curing HCV","~2.1 incremental QALYs vs. no treatment","Highly cost-effective (~$26,000-$29,000/QALY)",Complete elimination of all future HCV-related medical care,Return to workforce and avoidance of long-term disability,"High, one-time upfront cost creates ""budget shock"" for payers"
